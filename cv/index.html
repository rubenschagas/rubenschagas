            <br>
            This project aims to guide internship training through the automated deployment of a DevOps project,
            specifically a hackathon that incorporates a backend service supporting CRUD operations.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of this app is to build a basic structure for a backend application, along with an automated
            database. Upon sending requests to the backend, we can query and insert data into it.
            <br><br>
            The master carrier's structure revolves around trips, with dependencies on entities such as location
            (origin and destination types), product, vehicle and carrier.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, it will execute Postman collection tests against the backend and generate a visually
            appealing HTML report for the test run.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, there are specific objectives to achieve, including the implementation of standards,
            design patterns, code formatters, JDoc, building an authentication process, frontend development,
            introducing new entities, CI-CD, cloud, observability, and enhancements to application and business
            rules, among others.
            <br><br>
            Thus, the overall goal is to develop skills in the domains of DevOps, Development, QA, and SRE.

            I took the lead on new test automation projects (which did not exist in the company until then), introducing
            new tools, technologies, and methods to the entire team.
            <br>
            <br>
            These efforts resulted in improved product quality and facilitated a healthier development process while
